# Vectah
**Cross Platform Tool for viewing and organizing vector based icons.**

There are currently no cross-platform tools (as far as I am aware) for viewing and managing a large number of SVG icons on Windows and Linux. Svgsus exists but only on the Mac platform despite it being built on the Electron Framework. Nucleo is another app that can be used on both macOS and Windows but not on Linux. Vectah aims to be a free and open-source tool that can be used by artists and developers across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Here's a preliminary concept of what Vectah may look like:
