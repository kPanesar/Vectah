Cross Platform Tool for viewing and organizing vector based icons.

There are currently no good tools (as far as I am aware) for viewing and managing a large number of SVG icons on Windows or Linux. Svgsus exists but only on the Mac platform despite it being built with the Electron Framework. With this personal project, I hope to create a tool that can be used by artists and developers across multiple platforms.
