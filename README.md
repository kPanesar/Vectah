# Vectah
**Cross Platform Tool for viewing and organizing vector based icons.**

There are currently no tools (as far as I am aware) for viewing and managing a large number of SVG icons on Windows and Linux. Svgsus exists but only on the Mac platform despite it being built on the Electron Framework. With this personal project, I hope to create a free and open-source tool that can be used by artists and developers across multiple platforms.

Here's a preliminary concept of what Vectah may look like:
